Hello, I'm Ashford! I'm a guy from Belgium.  
I'm interested in 3ds cfw, pentesting and webdev.  
I'm currenty learning python and html/css, and looking to learn C.  
I'm working on my neocities website. I'm gonna look into deploy-to-neocities for that.
I'd like to make pentesting tools for the 3ds homebrew channel. In the far far future I'll work on a driver that lets you use wifi on Linux 3Ds.  
I'm interested in the development of neofeed, deploy-to-neocities, Linux 3ds.  
Reach me on discord. ashford#7467
